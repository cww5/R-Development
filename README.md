WARNING: I am aware that this presents some descrepancy because this could lead to academic dishonesty. My sole purpose for uploading these is so that potential employers and recruiters can view the type of work I have used.

# NJIT Academic Policy
Attached is a link to NJIT's Academic Policy:
Academic Integrity is the cornerstone of higher education and is central to the ideals of this course and the university. Cheating is strictly prohibited and devalues the degree that you are working on. As a member of the NJIT community, it is your responsibility to protect your educational investment by knowing and following the academic code of integrity policy that is found at: http://www5.njit.edu/policies/sites/policies/files/academic-integrity-code.pdf.

By copying these solutions, you directly violate the Academic Integrity. Any student found in violation of the code by cheating, plagiarizing or using any online software inappropriately will result in disciplinary action. This may include a failing grade of F, and/or suspension or dismissal from the university. If you have any questions about the code of Academic Integrity, please contact the Dean of Students Office at dos@njit.edu
